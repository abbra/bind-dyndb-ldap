1.0.0rc1
=======

[1] When connection to the LDAP was lost, the plugin didn't call the ldap_bind
during reconnection.

[2] Added new option "ldap_hostname" which allows to set LDAP server hostname
when it is different from actual /bin/hostname. This option sets the
LDAP_OPT_HOST_NAME option.

1.0.0b1
======

[1] Added new boolean option called "psearch". When this option is set to "yes"
then plugin will use advantage of psearch
(http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch-03.txt) to immediately
fetch new/modified/deleted zones from LDAP database. Note that the LDAP server
has to support the psearch as well.

[2] The plugin failed to set update ACLs for zones correctly.

[3] The FreeIPA CLI could have created update-policy attributes which contained
FQDNs ending with double-dot. Added a workaround to parse such crippled FQDNs.

[4] Race condition in semaphore_wait() could have caused server to hang.

[5] Major changes in the plugin code to make it more maintainable and readable.
