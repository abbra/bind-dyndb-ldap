2.2
======
[1] Compatibility with BIND 9.8 was restored.

2.1
======
[1] Forward policy "none" was introduced.

[3] Forwarding will be disabled after deleting associated forward zone.

2.0
======
[1] SOA serial number can be incremented automatically after each change
    in LDAP database. (Configuration option "serial_autoincrement".)

    is printed after 10*(timeout) seconds.
    Some deadlocks in various situations with low connection count were fixed.

[8] Libdns interface version >= 90 is supported properly.

[9] Zone transfers were fixed. Records with non-FQDNs are handled properly.

[10] Logging was improved.

[11] Memory leaks in dynamic update, persistent search, ldap_query
     and configurations with multiple plugin instances were fixed.

[12] Version numbering format changed to: [features].[bugfixes]

[13] Many other bugfixes

1.1.0rc1
======

[1] It was possible to DoS named service via query which contained non-alphabet
character. (CVE-2012-2134)

[2] The plugin wrote ambiguous "zone has been removed" messages to the log.

[3] The plugin failed to return A/AAAA delegation glue records.

[4] Fixes for memory leaks in code which handles Kerberos authentication.

1.1.0b2
======

[1] The plugin could incorrectly updated SOA record fields.

[2] The plugin could crashed on shutdown/reload when no zones in LDAP are
present.

[3] When using psearch, plugin could hung on shutdown/reload when connection to
LDAP was lost.

1.1.0b1
======

[1] Add support for IPv6 elements in idnsForwarders attribute
and make syntax compatible with BIND9 forwarders.

[2] Fix bug which caused named to crash during reload when failed to make a
connection to LDAP.

[3] Plugin is now able to fetch certain configuration options from LDAP. Check
README for more information.

[4] Many other bugfixes.

1.1.0a2
======

[1] Fix some errors reported by Coverity tool.

[2] Persistent search didn't propagate added/modified RRs to cache.

[3] DNS delegation now works fine.

[4] Relative domain names in resource records weren't expanded correctly
when psearch was used.

[5] The plugin could crash when LDAP contained DNS name with no data.

[6] Reworked idnsAllowQuery and idnsAllowTransfer support. We now 100% follow
BIND9 syntax.

[7] Fixed various bugs in code which synchronizes A/AAAA and it's PTR records.

1.1.0a1
======

[1] The plugin now skips only invalid record instead of the whole DN
when DN contains multiple records and one is invalid.

[2] New option "sync_ptr". When set to "yes" the plugin automatically
updates corresponding PTR records when A/AAAA update is received.
Zone must not have "idnsAllowDynUpdate" set to "no".

[3] New zone attribute idnsAllowSyncPTR which allows to enable PTR
synchronization per-zone.

[4] New idnsForwarders and idnsForwardPolicy attributes. You can set per-domain
forwarding with those options. See BIND 9 Administrator reference manual,
description of "forwarders", forward zones and "forward" options for details.

[5] Added support for zone transfers. Only AXFR is supported now.

[6] The plugin now periodically reconnects to LDAP when the first connection
attempt fails.

[7] New object class idnsConfigObject can be used to store plugin configuration
in LDAP. Only idnsForwarders option is currently supported. In future it's
planned to allow to store every bind-dyndb-ldap option valid in named.conf to be
stored in LDAP.

[8] Persistent search feature was extended to resource records.

[9] Many bugfixes, see git log for details.

1.0.0rc1
=======

[1] When connection to the LDAP was lost, the plugin didn't call the ldap_bind
during reconnection.

[2] Added new option "ldap_hostname" which allows to set LDAP server hostname
when it is different from actual /bin/hostname. This option sets the
LDAP_OPT_HOST_NAME option.

1.0.0b1
======

[1] Added new boolean option called "psearch". When this option is set to "yes"
then plugin will use advantage of psearch
(http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch-03.txt) to immediately
fetch new/modified/deleted zones from LDAP database. Note that the LDAP server
has to support the psearch as well.

[2] The plugin failed to set update ACLs for zones correctly.

[3] The FreeIPA CLI could have created update-policy attributes which contained
FQDNs ending with double-dot. Added a workaround to parse such crippled FQDNs.

[4] Race condition in semaphore_wait() could have caused server to hang.

[5] Major changes in the plugin code to make it more maintainable and readable.
